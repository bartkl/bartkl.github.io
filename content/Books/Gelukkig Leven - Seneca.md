<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1111464063">My rating</a>: ★★★☆☆

After having read Aurelius' Meditations, I found a quite different stoic in Seneca. Obviously the core principles are there: to live in virtue (according to nature) and refrain from intense emotions, desires and fears. However, Seneca emphasizes study as an important activity and believes that we shouldn't busy ourselves too much with societal activities. Aurelius seems to state the exact opposite: reading is a waste of time, it comes down to action, to doing things that benefit the community and mankind. As long as it's not about achieving wealth and status, I tend to agree more with Marcus Aurelius.

Seneca is often judged for being hypocritical. He is rich, succesful and very active in (high) society, yet he preaches one should refrain from most of this. He does, however, defend his wealth, stating that it is morally neutral and can be used as means to fulfill more virtuous deeds than without. I'm not too sure what to think of this, but overall Seneca can be a sharp thinker and eloquent writer. I found him inspiring and an interesting read.
